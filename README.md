# Vs-Tricky-Avg4k
an unfinished build of Vs. Tricky ported to Average4K's (old) engine.

## Code Quality

Avg4k's old engine is super messy (and thats what this is). Expect random shit to break and everything to not be good.

This was made with help with [CuckyDev](https://twitter.com/cuckydev), who helped me with OpenGL stuff. Huge thank you to him, he's awesome!



I am a very shitty programmer so enjoy this very shitty codebase, and most of this was stripped of Multiplayer or any thing confidental. but if I somehow missed a spot, please tell me.

be a nice person please and ty :))


## lib and include

I hate having to download stuff so all of that is included in the average4k folder, sorry if you don't like that. I do

fuck you.
